# Pulse-echo data

Because different logging tools from different vendors store their data in different ways, functions to extract tool data from DLIS files must be tailor-made for each tool. Pyintegrity then represents a pulse-echo measurement series, with all the measured waveforms, as a `PulseEchoSeries` object.


## Pulse-echo measurements

::: pyintegrity.pulseecho.series.PulseEchoSeries


## USIT data extraction

::: pyintegrity.pulseecho.usit.get_usit_data
::: pyintegrity.pulseecho.usit.get_usit_series
